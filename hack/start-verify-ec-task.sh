# Rough hacking guide:
#
#  * Commit your changes as required. (No need to push to GitHub.)
#
#  * Push a new base image and new task bundles like this:
#      env MY_QUAY_USER=$USER BUILD_TAG=$(git rev-parse HEAD) ./build-and-push.sh
#
#    (Assumes you have the required repos created in quay.io, you're signed in there with podman,
#    and your quay.io username matches $USER)
#
#  * Create a Secret in the current namespace containing the cosign.pub key. This should be a
#    partial copy of the Secret tekton-chains/signing-secrets. Only the public key should be
#    included in this Secret. By default the name of the Secret is 'cosign-public-key', set
#    the PUBLIC_KEY_SECRET environment variable to use a different name. For example:
#    oc -n tekton-chains get secret signing-secrets -o json | jq '.data."cosign.pub" | @base64d' -r > cosign.pub
#    oc create secret generic cosign-public-key --from-file=cosign.pub
#
#  * Make sure you have an image that has already been signed by Chains.
#
#  * Run this script:
#      ./start-verify-ec-task.sh <image-ref>
#    where <image-ref> is a valid image reference, e.g. quay.io/spam/bacon@sha256:...
#
#
# See also hack/chains/release-pipeline-with-ec-demo.sh in the infra-deployments repo
# for a more functional demo showing the EC task being used in a pipeline.
